- 👋 Hi, I’m @jeankresge and Im a beginner in all sense of the word. Trying to teach myself arduino, robot build, internet of things projects with elegoo complete starter kit. Im jumping through rabbit holes on youtube. 
- 👀 I’m interested in designing a system to replace manual cranck and steel wire pully system operating my 89 Jayco sportster l7 popup truck camper roof with:
- a bluetooth remote controlled camper automation app on my cell phone with offgrid network
- synchrinize four 12v 30" stroke synchronized linear actuators that can extend 66" 
- utilize smart magnets between actuator bottom /  top and between underside of floor / roof to reduce loads and extend, stop, retract without force to lightweight camper
- 4 in one power coupling
- 4 in one momentum switch
- 4 in one motor controls to synchronize speed, distance, and level lift weight 
   

- 🌱 I’m currently learning arduino uno R3 with elegoo complete learning kit with breadboard projects and youtube tutorial videos, c code, electricity and how to select right type and component values to design circuits, want to know how to read and apply wiring diagrams, building jimu and hex toy robots to better understand mechanics, learning tinkercad and how to generate cad from 3-d scan and prints.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on project to retrofit lightweight manual pipup roof lift, magnetic lock, and retract as part of one system in camper home automation
