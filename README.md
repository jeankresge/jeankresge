Retired Cisco Program Manager.
Lately: Learning to code (C, Python, and Java) and how to adopt AI Arch to develop a web app for home exchanges.
Like to tinker in the shed with electronics and learning how to build robots on Arduino / Raspberry Pi projects.

I'm also doing r&d for an invention to fix my old jayco pop-up top slide-in truck camper with floor mounted actuators
Oh also developing a home exchange website using Google Cloud, React, VS Studio and some wicked AI features to set it apart from the competition.
